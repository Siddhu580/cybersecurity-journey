# Wireshark Setup for TCP Handshake Lab

1. Open Wireshark
2. Click on "Capture" -> "Options"
3. Select interface: Loopback (lo)
4. Apply filter to view only TCP traffic for port 8002:
   tcp.port == 8002
5. Open captured file:
   File -> Open -> LEARN.pcap
6. Analyze the handshake:
   - First packet: SYN from client
   - Second packet: SYN+ACK from server
   - Third packet: ACK from client
7. Follow the TCP Stream:
   Right-click on a packet -> Follow -> TCP Stream
8. Observe sequence numbers, acknowledgment numbers, flags (SYN, ACK, FIN, PSH)
9. Use coloring rules to highlight important packets:
   - SYN packets: Blue
   - SYN+ACK packets: Green
   - ACK packets: Yellow
   - FIN packets: Red
